What if these items are become between DAPPs or Games and can be used as real agreement about an ownership of an NFT. In a really basic situation let's see your Cryptokitties can be used a Non-effect aka. Cosmetic item in some 2d RPG.
In near future NFT's will become so big market like Steam items nowadays, but unless that every game create his own Clothes,Weapons,Badges which is exclusively supported, on the Blockchain we can step to a next level where items are more eternal/valuable.
